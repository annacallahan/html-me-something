                <p id="Main1">Spring is finally here! Thanks God! Winter is the worst, especially in St. Louis. I can’t wait until I am old so I can migrate down to Florida every winter and live in one of those communities where everyone drives golf carts and wears Hawaiian shirts. But alas, spring has sprung! TBH, the weather still kind of sucks here, but I am trying to get past that. So as a celebration of winter’s death, I made a super fun and absolutely adorable floral strapless shirt with…wait for it…… pom pom trim! It is quite literally a party on your shirt! And it’s so easy.</p>

                <h2>How To Make The Pattern</h2>
                <p>This pattern is super easy because it’s only 2 pieces, two trapezoids. For the strapless top part of the shirt, measure around your chest right under your armpits. Add 6 inches onto your measurement. Then divide that number by 2 because we are only making half of the pattern. This is your bust width measurement. Now add 4 inches onto your bust width measurement to get the bottom width measurement. The top and sleeves both flair out slightly at the bottom. As your can see on my pattern, I have a small side diagonal line towards the top, but this is completely wrong and I had to correct it later. So don’t do what I did. Lastly figure out how long you want your shirt to be. </p>
                <p>The sleeves fit very loosely and follow the same trapezoid shape as the top. Measure around your bicep then add  2inches. Divide this number by 2 also, for the same reason. This is your arm width measurement. Now add 5 inches to create the faired sleeve. This is your wrist measurement. Lastly figure out how long you want your sleeve.</p>

                 <h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
                <p class="maintext">Lay your front top piece over your back top piece so that the right sides are facing each other. Pin along the sides. Sew the sides together, stitching about ½ an inch away from the edge.</p>
                <img src="/Users/anna.callahan/Documents/LC101/html-me-something/images/TBB Strapless Pom 5.png" alt="Step 1 Image">
                <p class="maintext">Now we are going to make a tube for the elastic. Turn your top inside out and fold over ¾ of an inch and pin. If your elastic is wider than ½ inch, adjust accordingly. Repeat all the way around the top. Don’t sew just yet. Mark off a one-inch section of the tube with pins and don’t sew this shut. This is where we are going to feed the elastic through.</p>
                 <img src="/Users/anna.callahan/Documents/LC101/html-me-something/images/TBB Strapless Pom 4.png" alt="Step 2 Image">
                <p class="maintext">Once you have your tube sewn, it’s ready for the elastic. Wrap your elastic around your chest under your arms to see how much you need. Make sure its tight enough to avoid any awkward wardrobe malfunctions. Attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic and pin the other end to your fabric so it doesn’t get lost in the tube. Feed the elastic through the tube. Sew the ends of the elastic together and backstitch quite a few times. Sew the one-inch hole closed.</p>

                <p class="maintext">Hem the top and the bottom of both sleeves.</p>
                <img src="/Users/anna.callahan/Documents/LC101/html-me-something/images/TBB Strapless Pom 16.png" alt="Step 4 Image">
                <p class="maintext">Take one sleeve and fold it in half so that the sides match up. Make sure the right sides of the fabric are facing each other. Pin the sides and sew them together. Repeat for the other sleeve.</p>
                <img src="/Users/anna.callahan/Documents/LC101/html-me-something/images/TBB Strapless Pom 13.png" alt="Step 5 Image">
                <p class="maintext">Take your sleeve, line up the side seam of your sleeve with the side seam of your top and pin. Starting at the top stitch about one inch down to keep the two together.</p>

                <p class="maintext">If you want to add pom pom or lace trim to your shirt, turn it inside out and pin your trim to the bottom of the shirt and the sleeves. Sew it down and you’re done!</p>
